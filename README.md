# Software Engineering Assessment 1 - Weather Console App

**Product Description:**
This Weather Console App utilises data obtained from _OpenWeather_ api's to create a seemless user experience in which they can input their wanted location to view the current and forecasted weather. The current weather data provides multiple differing analytics such as temperature, description, pressure and humidity whilst the 5 day forcast only provides the upcoming temperature.
